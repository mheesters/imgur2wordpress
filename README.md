# imgur2wordpress

Move your embedded imgur hosted images to your Wordpress site

If your WP blog uses imgur images, but you want to transfer them to WP itself, you can use this script to download them. (imgur.sh)
After this you can search/replace the links in your database so they point to WP. (dbreplace.sh)

Requirements:
- Bash or alike
- https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli

⚠️ Use/modify at your own risk.. ⚠️
